# Tournament
Second project for teh Udacity full Stack Nano Degree

In order to access the functions built in the tournament.py
file, clone the repository and use the Postgres console 
to import the tournament.sql file in order to create the 
database. The command to do so is: 
    psql -f tournament.sql
    
Import the module to your file and thatÂ´s it. The functions in the file are the
following:

        except psycopg2.Error as error:
